# top_trumps_app

I have hopefully made this as easy to use as possible and deployed it as a web app online using PythonAnywhere. It can be accessed via:

aidanbdaly.pythonanywhere.com

If however you want to run it manually, and unfortunately I am only sure of how to do this on linux, then:
- Download the repository
- In the top_trumps_app/ directory, open a terminal
- Type $ source venv/bin/activate
- Open up __init__.py in your favourite IDE
- The app should be hosted on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ unless stated otherwise by the Python console
